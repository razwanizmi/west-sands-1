        <p>
          Located in North Ari Atoll, Ukulhas is a tiny 57 acre island. It
          offers unparalled beauty - with one of the most beautiful beaches in
          the area, combined with thick natural vegetations. Surrounding it are
          few of the most spectacular diving and marine life sites in Maldives.
